## Hello there, I'm Doquyen ðŸ‘‹

### I am an undergraduate in Software Engineering from Vietnam.

- I'm learning Java and C++ for Software and Game Development. In the future, I want to specialize in Graphics Programming utilizing OpenGL and Vulkan.

- Currently, I'm diving in 2D graphics using the SDL2 framework, I hope to learn many things and expand my knowledge in Software Development to apply it elsewhere later.

## Cheers!
